Process: An instance of a program (e.g. a Python interpreter)

+++++++ Advantages +++++++++++
+ Process can have multiple threads inside
+ Takes advantage of multiples CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

------- Disadvantages ----------
- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
