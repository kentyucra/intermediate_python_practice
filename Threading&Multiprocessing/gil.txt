GIL: Global interpreter lock
- A lock allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python
- Needed in CPython becasue memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid
    * Use multiprocessing
    * Use a different, free-threaded Python inplementation (Jython, IronPython)
    * Use python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
